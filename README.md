## Design

The app has five key area that we will build out step-by-step

1. Characters
2. Locations
3. Episodes
4. Settings
5. Search

As we build each section of the project, you'll learn about proper design practices, trade off making, separation of concerns, and more. Moreover, you'll see how you can build and deploy an app on multiple platforms (mac, iOS, iPadOS).

## Testing & Notes

- This project will be fully unit and UI tested in an upcoming series. Given the size and breadth of the project, I've decided to intentionally separate this to make it more digestible.
- I plan to submit this to the App Store and will link a video for that here as well
